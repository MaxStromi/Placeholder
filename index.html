    <h5>The Internet Archive</h5>
    <p1>
        The Internet Archive is a giant repository for Internet preservation. It is not only a repository, but it is the biggest on the internet.
        The Internet Archive's goal is to allow universal access to resources. In other words, a digital library that anyone can access at anytime for free.
        It is an admirable goal, which is why so many people use it and support it.
    </p1>
    <p2>I personally use the Internet Archive as a tool for fun or when I need something. It is a giant repository containing a wide range of games, websites, and books.
    It is a great resource to use when you need to find something credible from a textbook or video. It is also a great tool to use when you are up at 3am
    trying to find an old webpage that used to host the digital manual for Ratchet & Clank: QFB on the PS3 (P.S. I am still searching). 
    Besides that, the Internet Archive is a commendable site that deserves more recognition for the goal that it is trying to accomplish. It has been through legal battles,
     but it still survives to this day, to archive our childhoods.</p2>
